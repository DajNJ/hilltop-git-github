# What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

## It is used for:

- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration
# Why Git?
- Over 70% of developers use Git!
- Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
- Developers can see the full history of the project.
- Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
# What is GitHub?
- Git is not the same as GitHub.
- GitHub makes tools that use Git.
- GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.

Git Install
You can download Git for free from the following website: https://www.git-scm.com/
´´´bash
git --version
git version 2.30.2.windows.1
´´´
Configure Git
Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
´´´bash
git config --global user.name "w3schools-test"
git config --global user.email "test@w3schools.com"
´´´
