# **Git: A Complete Guide from Basics to Advanced Workflows**

## **Introduction to Git**

### **What is Git?**
Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)** that helps developers track changes in their codebase. Created by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005, Git allows:
- Tracking every modification to files
- Collaborating with other developers
- Reverting to previous versions when needed
- Managing multiple parallel development streams

### **Why Use Git?**
- **Version History:** Never lose previous work
- **Team Collaboration:** Multiple people can work simultaneously
- **Branching:** Isolate features/bug fixes without affecting main code
- **Open Source:** Free and widely adopted (used by >90% of developers)

### **Git vs GitHub**
- **Git:** The version control software that runs locally
- **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:** Cloud platforms that host Git repositories with additional features

## **Getting Started with Git**

### **1. Installation**
Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and verify:
```bash
git --version
# Should show e.g. "git version 2.39.2"
```

### **2. Configuration**
Set your identity (used in commits):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### **3. Creating Your First Repository**
```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init  # Initializes empty Git repo
```

---

## **Basic Git Workflow with Files**

### **Scenario 1: Creating and Tracking a Single File**
1. **Create a new file:**
   ```bash
   touch README.md
   ```

2. **Add content:**
   ```bash
   echo "# My Project" >> README.md
   ```

3. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   git status  # Shows README.md as untracked
   ```

4. **Stage the file:**
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   ```

5. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add project README"
   ```

---

### **Scenario 2: Working with Multiple Files**
1. **Create multiple files:**
   ```bash
   touch index.html style.css script.js
   ```

2. **Add content to each:**
   ```bash
   echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" > index.html
   echo "body { color: red; }" > style.css
   echo "console.log('Hello')" > script.js
   ```

3. **Stage all files at once:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit together:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add initial website files"
   ```

---

### **Scenario 3: Modifying Existing Files**
1. **Edit a file:**
   ```bash
   echo "<h1>Welcome</h1>" >> index.html
   ```

2. **Check changes:**
   ```bash
   git diff  # Shows unstaged changes
   ```

3. **Stage and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add heading to index.html"
   ```

# **Git Branching: Concepts, Importance, and Naming Strategies**

## **What is a Git Branch?**

A **branch** in Git is an independent line of development that allows you to:
- Work on new features without affecting the main codebase
- Fix bugs in isolation
- Experiment safely
- Maintain different versions (e.g., production vs development)

**Technical Definition:**  
A branch is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a specific commit in your repository's history.

## **Why Branching is Important**

1. **Isolation of Work**  
   - Developers can work independently without stepping on each other's changes
   - Prevents unstable code from breaking the main project

2. **Parallel Development**  
   - Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
   - Different teams can work on separate components

3. **Risk Reduction**  
   - Changes can be tested thoroughly before merging
   - Easy to discard unsuccessful experiments

4. **Organized Workflow**  
   - Clear separation of concerns (features, releases, hotfixes)
   - Better historical tracking of changes

## **Branch Naming in GitFlow Strategy**

GitFlow is a popular branching model that defines strict naming conventions:

### **1. Main Branches (Permanent)**
| Branch Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `main`/`master` | Production-ready code (always deployable) |
| `develop` | Integration branch for features (pre-release state) |

### **2. Supporting Branches (Temporary)**
| Branch Type | Naming Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| **Feature** | `feature/*` | New functionality | `feature/user-auth` |
| **Release** | `release/*` | Preparing for production | `release/v1.2.0` |
| **Hotfix** | `hotfix/*` | Critical production fixes | `hotfix/login-bug` |
| **Bugfix** | `bugfix/*` | Non-critical fixes | `bugfix/typo-123` |

### **3. Common Naming Best Practices**
- Use **lowercase** with hyphens (`feature/new-dashboard`)
- Prefix with branch type (`fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`)
- Reference issue IDs when applicable (`feature/PROJ-123-add-search`)
- Keep names **short but descriptive** (avoid generic names like `patch-1`)

## **Visualizing GitFlow Branches**

```
main
â””â”€â”€ develop
    â”œâ”€â”€ feature/user-auth
    â”œâ”€â”€ feature/payment-gateway
    â”œâ”€â”€ release/v1.3.0
    â””â”€â”€ hotfix/login-error
```

## **When to Create Branches**
1. **Starting a new feature** â†’ `git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature`
2. **Preparing a release** â†’ `git checkout -b release/v1.4.0`
3. **Fixing critical bugs** â†’ `git checkout -b hotfix/db-connection`

## **Branch Lifecycle**
1. Create from `develop` (for features) or `main` (for hotfixes)
2. Work locally and push to remote
3. Merge via Pull Request (GitHub/GitLab)
4. Delete after merging (keeps repository clean)

**Pro Tip:**  
Use `git branch -a` to view all branches (local + remote) and `git fetch --prune` to clean up deleted remote branches.

---

## **Working with Remote Repositories**

### **1. Connect to GitHub**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### **2. Push Changes**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### **3. Pull Updates**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## **Advanced Scenarios**

### **Undoing Changes**
| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Unstage a file | `git reset HEAD file` |
| Discard local changes | `git checkout -- file` |
| Amend last commit | `git commit --amend` |

### **Viewing History**
```bash
git log --oneline --graph  # Compact view with branch visualization
```
